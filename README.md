# SmokeSegmentation
Project on smoke detection from CS231a (Spring 2017)

Run FinalProject.py to observe results on a few images
Run FinalProject_vid.py to observe results on frames of a video
The other files (Canny.py and Harris.py) were used for early experimentation on the promise of various algorithms.

FinalProject.py has a function canny_smoke that includes an optional visualization of the overlap between canny edges and border region by segment in the segmented image.
